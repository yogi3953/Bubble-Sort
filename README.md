# Bubble-Sort
Bubble Sort Algorithm Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

# How It Works:
Compare the first two elements of the array.
If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
Move to the next pair and repeat step 2.
Continue this process for all elements in the array.
Repeat the entire pass until no more swaps are needed.
